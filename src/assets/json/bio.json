    "about": [
        "I have worked as Data Analyst for 7 years, starting my path from learning Excel and SQL. After learning basics, the main issue for me became doing routine tasks manually and working with big datasets (over 100k of rows), which required significant amount of time. So I decided to start learning Python and automate the work I was doing.",
        "In order to learn basics, I took several courses on Udemy and Coursera, but that was not enough - so I went to Kood/Jõhvi to become full-stack developer. My skills: Golang, SQL, Python, Angular, Rust"
